Make it simple, but powerfully

## What's this?

It is a DBMS that packs powerful functions into a simple interface to make it simpler and easier to use than other DBMSs

## How do I use it?

It's currently unavailable. We're still working hard to implement the features on the SPAC, and it's expected to be completed as early as the end of this year or as late as next year, and the release will probably be somewhere after that

## Is it open-source?

Unfortunately, this project is following its own license, not open source, and violating this license may cause problems. However, the code is open, so if you have any questions, please check the license for more information
